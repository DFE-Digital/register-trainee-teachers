Register trainee teachers (Register) is the service that replaced the Database of Trainee Teachers & Providers (DTTP) in 2022.

Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers use Register to provide the Department for Education (DfE) with their trainee data.

The DfE uses trainee data in Register to:

* allocate the correct amount of funding to training providers and eligible trainees
* create the ITT census publication
* create the ITT performance profiles publication
* inform policy development

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Access to Register for accredited providers</h2>

Accredited providers can perform tasks for their trainees in Register, these include:

* withdrawing or deferring trainees from their course
* getting a teacher reference number (TRN)
* recommending trainees for qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS)

If you have trainees eligible for funding, you can view funding information from the 2021 to 2022 academic year onwards. You can view this from the main navigation bar under ‘Funding’. Accredited providers will see monthly payments paid and predicted to be paid for scholarships and bursaries.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Access to Register for lead schools</h2>

Lead schools that deliver School Direct initial teacher training (ITT) courses in partnership with an accredited provider, can access Register to:

* view trainee records where you’re their lead school
* view funding from the 2021 to 2022 academic year onwards if you have eligible trainees

Access to Register for lead schools is view only. As a lead school you cannot:

* add a trainee record
* change trainee records
* view draft trainee records
* view a trainee’s diversity information

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage</h2>

When you log into Register, on the homepage you’ll see a section called ‘Draft trainees’ and a section called ‘Registered trainees’. Under ‘Registered trainees’ there are ‘training statuses’ where trainees are grouped by:

* course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started)
* in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred)
* currently deferred
* awarded this year (all trainees awarded QTS or EYTS in the current academic year)
* incomplete records (registered trainees that are missing data)

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How Register relates to the initial teacher training (ITT) census publication</h2>

Every academic year, the DfE publishes a census of trainee teachers who are starting their training. This is so we have an idea of who could be entering the teaching workforce and can plan teacher recruitment activities.

The ITT census happens in September and October every year. We‘ll notify you about the exact dates each year. 

Once you register your new trainees, your trainee data gets analysed and filtered for the ITT census publication. Not all your new trainees will be included in the ITT census publication, to understand what data will be used read the [Initial Teacher Training Census methodology.](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology)

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Registering trainees and signing off new trainee data</h2>

At the start of every academic year, during September and October, you’ll need to register your new trainees and sign off your new trainee data before the end of October. We ask you to sign off your data so we know it’s accurate for the ITT census publication.

Find out what the [dates and deadlines are for the 2022 to 2023 academic year](/guidance/dates-and-deadlines).

Training providers that do not use the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) data collection system should register their trainees manually in the Register service. 

Read about how to [register your trainees manually](/guidance/manually-registering-trainees).

Training providers who use HESA, should submit their data through HESA. Your data will then be imported into Register where you can check it.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Who you should register</h3>

You should register all trainees who start their training, even if they decide to drop out after the first few weeks. If they do drop out, you can withdraw them.

Not registering trainees who drop out early means we do not have any record of them, which could affect funding payments.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Checking and signing off your organisation’s data</h3>

Once you’ve registered your trainees, you’ll need to check your data is correct. You can do this in Register by:

* using the new ‘Reports’ section and exporting a CSV of your new trainees for the 2022 to 2023 academic year (available in Register soon)
* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one

Once you’re confident your new trainee data is correct, a senior person from your organisation (this should be a different person to who submitted the data) must sign it off at the end of October every academic year.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How Register relates to ITT performance profiles</h2>

Every academic year, the DfE publishes data on GOV.UK of how many people have successfully completed their teacher training.

Training providers need to update their trainee data every January from the previous academic year.

For example, in January 2023 a training provider should update their trainee data for the 2021 to 2022 academic year. This data will be published in July 2023 on GOV.UK. The data published on GOV.UK will be the performance profiles of trainees who successfully completed their training in the 2021 to 2022 academic year.
