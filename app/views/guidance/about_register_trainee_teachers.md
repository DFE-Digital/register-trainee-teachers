Register trainee teachers (Register) is the service that Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers use to provide the Department for Education (DfE) with trainee data.

The DfE uses this trainee data to:

* allocate the correct amount of funding to training providers and eligible trainees
* [create the ITT census publication](/guidance/census-sign-off)
* [create the ITT performance profiles publication](/guidance/performance-profiles)
* inform policy development

## Access to Register
### Access for accredited providers

Accredited providers can use Register to perform tasks for their trainees, such as:

* withdrawing or deferring trainees from their course
* adding trainee placement data
* getting a teacher reference number (TRN)
* changing a trainee’s status to qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS)

Accredited providers can view funding information for the current academic year for eligible trainees. From the main navigation bar under ‘Funding’, you will see monthly payments paid and predicted to be paid for scholarships and bursaries.

Previously accredited providers who become training partners will continue to perform tasks for their trainees in the 2024 to 2025 academic year.

### Access for training partners

Training partners include:

* schools (previously called lead schools)
* higher education institutions (HEIs)
* trusts or hubs
* commercial organisations

Training partners in partnership with accredited providers can use Register to:

* view trainee records
* view funding information for the current academic year onwards for eligible trainees

Training partners access to Register is **view only**. For trainees starting training in the 2024/25 academic year onwards, you can not do the following as a training partner:

* add a trainee record
* change trainee records
* view draft trainee records
* view a trainee’s diversity information
* change status for QTS or EYTS

## How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage

When you sign into Register you will see ‘Draft trainees’ and ‘Registered trainees’ sections on the homepage.

‘Registered trainees’ are grouped by the following ‘training statuses’:

* **‘Course not started yet’** - trainees who are registered but their course has not started
* **‘In training’** - all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred
* **‘Currently deferred’**
* **‘Gained this year’** - all trainees that gained QTS or EYTS in the current academic year
* **‘Incomplete records’** - registered trainees that are missing data

## How trainee data is used in the initial teacher training (ITT) census publication

The DfE publishes a census each academic year of trainee teachers who are starting their training. This is to get an idea of who could be entering the teaching workforce and to plan teacher recruitment activities.

Once you register your new trainees, your trainee data gets analysed and filtered for the ITT census publication. Not all your new trainees will be included in the ITT census publication. To understand what data will be used read the [Initial Teacher Training Census methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology).

The ITT census happens in September and October every year. We‘ll notify you about the exact dates each year.

## How Register relates to ITT performance profiles

Every academic year the DfE publishes data on GOV.UK of how many people have successfully completed their teacher training.

Training providers must update their trainee data every January from the previous academic year.
