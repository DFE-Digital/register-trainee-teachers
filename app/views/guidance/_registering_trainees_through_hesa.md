Training providers that use HESA need to submit data through the HESA data collection system to register their trainees. Your trainee data will then be imported into Register where you can check it.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage</h2>

When you log into Register, on the homepage you’ll see a section called ‘Draft trainees’ and a section called ‘Registered trainees’. Under ‘Registered trainees’ there are ‘training statuses’ where trainees are grouped by:

* course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started)
* in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred)
* currently deferred
* awarded this year (all trainees awarded QTS or EYTS in the current academic year)
* incomplete records (registered trainees that are missing data)

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking data imported into Register from HESA</h2>

Once your data has been imported into Register, you can check it. There are 3 ways to do this in Register and you can choose whichever one suits you. These are:

* using the new ‘Reports’ section and exporting a CSV of your new trainees for the 2022 to 2023 academic year (available in Register soon)
* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one

In the CSV export from Register, we’ve also included a column called ‘hesa_updated_at’ which shows you the last time a record was updated through HESA. You can use this column to check all your new trainees have imported into Register.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How Register defines ‘withdrawn’ and ‘deferred’ trainees</h3>

A ‘deferred’ trainee in Register is a trainee who is registered on a course but then decides to defer to a later date or academic year. In Register, trainees can be deferred if they have started their ITT course or if they never start their ITT course.

In HESA ‘dormant‘ trainee means the same as ’deferred’ in Register. You can record deferred trainees in HESA by using the [Student.MODE field](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/mode).

A ‘withdrawn‘ trainee in Register is a trainee that is registered on an ITT course, started that course, but then decides to withdraw from the qualified teacher status (QTS) part of the course and will not return.

In HESA, withdrawn trainees are recorded by using the [Student.ENDDATE](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/enddate) field and the [Student.RSNEND](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/rsnend) field.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Expected end date for trainees</h2>

HESA has added a new field in their collection for the 2022 to 2023 academic year called [‘expected end date’ (EXPECTEDENDDATE)](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c22053/e/expectedenddate). 

The Register service requires this field to issue TRNs and for funding purposes. You must fill out this field in HESA, it will then import into Register as ‘ITT end date’.

You should keep this field up to date throughout the trainee’s training.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Recommending a trainee for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)</h2>

When a trainee has successfully completed their training (or completed their assessment for an ‘assessment only’ route) and met the required standards, you can recommend them for QTS or EYTS in the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) portal.
