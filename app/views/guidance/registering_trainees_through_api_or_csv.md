If you want to bulk upload trainee details, you can use our CSV and API functionality to do this.  
 
 
## How to use CSV bulk upload 

### 1. Download the CSV file template 

The CSV can be adapted to add data directly from your student record system. [Download empty bulk add new trainees CSV template](/bulk-update/add-trainees/empty-template.csv).

### 2. Add new trainee details 

There are 36 data fields. They contain a mix of mandatory and conditional fields. 

### 3. Upload your trainee records 

Your trainee data is checked after you upload the file. We will notify you by email whether the upload has passed or failed. Emails are not currently sent from the CSV sandbox environment. 

You can read more detailed guidance on the [How to add trainee information to the bulk add new trainee CSV template](/csv-docs/#how-to-add-trainee-information-to-the-bulk-add-new-trainee-csv-template) page. 
 

## How to use API bulk upload 

The API works directly with your SRS system. To use this, you need to talk to your SRS vendor to enable seamless integration.  

The API works by using a unique authentication token to link your data with Register trainee teachers. You can create your own token by navigating to the ‘organisation’ section of the Register service. 

For full guidance see the [Register API documentation](/api-docs/#register-api-documentation).
