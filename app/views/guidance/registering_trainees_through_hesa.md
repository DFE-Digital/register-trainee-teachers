Training providers that use HESA can submit data through the HESA data collection system to register their trainees.  

Your trainee data will then be imported into Register. You’ll be able to view or export it, including your trainees’ teacher reference numbers (TRNs). 

[Find out when you should submit your trainee data](/guidance/dates-and-deadlines).

## How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage

When you sign in to Register, on the homepage you’ll see a section called ‘Draft trainees’ and a section called ‘Registered trainees’. In ‘Registered trainees’ you can filter the list by ‘training statuses’ which are: 

* course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started) 
* in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred) 
* deferred 
* awarded 
* withdrawn 

You can also filter the list by ‘record completion’. Incomplete records have data missing. 

## Checking data imported into Register from HESA

Once your data has been imported into Register, you can check it. At any time you can: 

* export a CSV file listing your trainees from the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘academic year’ or ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year 
* check your trainees directly in the service one by one 

In the CSV export from the ‘Registered trainees’ section, we’ve included a column called ‘hesa_updated_at’ which shows you the last time a record was updated through HESA. You can use this column to check that all your new trainees have imported into Register. 

You can also export CSV files from the ‘Reports’ section when you need to sign off your:  

* new trainees for the census in October  
* trainees from the previous academic year for performance profiles in January
