    <p class="govuk-body-m">You are required to have school placement data in Register.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You only need to provide location information about placements – the URN (if known) or the school/setting name and postcode.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You do not need to provide duration of time spent at each placement.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to include placement data as part of the <%= @previous_academic_cycle.label %> performance profiles sign off period</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">A minimum of 2 placements is required for each trainee who have been awarded QTS or EYTS in the <%= @previous_academic_cycle.label %> academic year.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Manually record placement data</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">Manual input is recommended for providers with a small number of registered trainees.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You must use manual input if you do not have placement school URNs.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Bulk update placement data</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">Bulk update is recommended for those providers who have many registered trainees to manage.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">You can only use bulk update if you have the school placement URN.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">Alternatively, you can use the <%= govuk_link_to("bulk update placement feature", bulk_upload_placement_data_guidance_path ) %> to fill in any data gaps.</p>
    <% end %>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why collecting placements data is important</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">Trainee teachers need varied classroom experience and must have taught classes to pupils in two schools prior to the award of Qualified Teacher Status. This is called ‘placements’.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">If we collect placement data in one place, we can analyse and use it to inform policy decisions, and help providers find placements more efficiently and effectively.</p>
