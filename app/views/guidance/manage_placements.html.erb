    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Manage your trainee placement data</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You are now required to have school placement data in Register.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">This new requirement will be tied to trainees who studied in the <%= @previous_academic_cycle.label %> academic year for performance profiles sign off. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">The performance profile sign off period starts in <%= @performance_profile_sign_off_start_period %> with a deadline of <%= @performance_profile_sign_off_full_deadline %>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What type of school placement data is required</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You only need to provide location information about placements – the URN (if known) or the school name and postcode.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">^ You do not need to provide duration of time spent at each placement</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to include placement data as part of the <%= @previous_academic_cycle.label %> performance profiles sign off period</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">A minimum of 2 placements is required for each registered trainee with a successful course outcome in the <%= @previous_academic_cycle.label %> academic year.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">^ HEI providers will be notified by email in early <%= @performance_profile_sign_off_short_deadline %> when their placement data has been imported into Register for them to check and fill in any missing placement information. We will only import the URN from the student collection. </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Manually record placement data</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">Manual input is recommended for providers with a small number of registered trainees.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You must use manual input if you do not have school placement URNs.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">Find out how to include placement data in trainee records manually.</p>

    <% if FeatureService.enabled?(:bulk_placements) %>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Bulk upload placement data</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">Bulk upload is recommended for those providers who have many registered trainees to manage.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">You can only use bulk upload if you have the school placement URN.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-m">Find out <%= govuk_link_to("how to bulk upload missing placement data", bulk_upload_placement_data_guidance_path ) %></p>
    <% end %>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Placement data in Register next steps</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">You’ll be asked for feedback about your experience of adding placement data into Register.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">We’ll review the feedback to further improve the process to update placement data throughout the year, as standard practice.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">We’ll also review if more detail is needed about placements, for example, if we require duration (length of time) of each placement.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why collecting placements data is important</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">Trainee teachers need varied classroom experience and must have taught classes to pupils in two schools prior to the award of Qualified Teacher Status. This is called ‘placements’.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-m">If we collect placement data in one place, we can analyse and use it to inform policy decisions, and help providers find placements more efficiently and effectively.</p>
