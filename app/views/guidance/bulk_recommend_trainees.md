## How to bulk recommend trainees for QTS or EYTS

1. Make sure you are signed into Register. Click into ‘Bulk updates’ in the main navigation.
2. Download a CSV file listing the trainees eligible to gain QTS or EYTS.
3. Fill in the date when each trainee gained QTS or EYTS.
4. Upload the CSV file. If there are any errors, fix them and upload the file again.
5. Check the list of trainees whose status will change and submit your changes.


### 1. Sign into Register

Once you have signed into Register, you can [access the bulk status change feature](/bulk-update/recommend/choose-who-to-recommend).

### 2. Download a CSV file listing trainees eligible to gain QTS or EYTS

The CSV file includes data for all trainees who have both a teacher reference number (TRN) and either:

- an expected end date in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- no expected end date

The CSV file does not include trainees who have deferred or withdrawn.

If a trainee’s expected end date is not in the period covered by the CSV file, you can choose to either:

- update their expected end date so that it’s in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- change their QTS or EYTS status from within their individual trainee record

### 3. Fill in the date when each trainee gained QTS or EYTS

The CSV file has a blank column for you to fill in the date when trainees gained QTS or EYTS. This may be different to the date when they finish their course or get an academic qualification.

You can only change the status of trainees who gained QTS or EYTS in the past 12 months. If a trainee gained QTS or EYTS longer ago, you need to change their information separately from within their trainee record.

If a trainee has not met the requirements, you can choose to either:

- delete the row
- leave the date blank in the CSV file

Do not make any other changes to the CSV file.

### 4. Upload the CSV file and fix any errors

You’ll get an error message when you upload the CSV file if you:

- entered a date which cannot be accepted, such as a date in the future
- edited any data in the CSV (you cannot change trainee or course details using this process)

If there are any errors in the CSV file, you’ll be able to download a version showing the errors.

You can choose to either:

- fix the errors
- skip the errors and continue

If you skip the errors, you’ll only be able to change the status of trainees whose data does not have errors. You can fix these errors and re-submit later.

### 5. Submit your changes

After you submit your changes, the Department for Education will let rrainees know of thier status changes within 3-5 working days.

Trainees will be sent an email to tell them that their certificates are available to download from the Access your Teacher Qualifications service.
