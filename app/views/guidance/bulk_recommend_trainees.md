You can use Register trainee teachers (Register) to tell us which trainees now hold qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS) with the bulk selection feature.

You cannot use this process to record other training outcomes or to change trainee or course details.

Find out [how to withdraw, defer, reinstate or recommend an individual trainee for QTS or EYTS](/guidance/withdraw-defer-reinstate-or-recommend-a-trainee).

You can change other trainee or course details in an individual trainee’s record. You can also use the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) service if you have access to it.

## How to select trainees that now hold QTS or EYTS

1. Make sure you are signed into Register. Click into ‘Bulk updates’ in the main navigation.
2. Go to the second section named ‘Selecting trainees that now hold QTS or EYTS’
3. Download a CSV file listing the trainees you can select for QTS or EYTS.
4. Fill in the date when each trainee met QTS or EYTS requirement.
5. Upload the CSV file. If there are any errors, fix them and upload the file again.
6. Check the list of trainees you are going to select and then submit your selection.


### 1. Sign into Register

Once you have signed into Register, you can [access the bulk recommendation feature](/bulk-update/select/choose-who-to-select).

### 2. Download a CSV file listing trainees you can select that now hold QTS or EYTS

The CSV file includes data for all trainees who have both a teacher reference number (TRN) and either:

- an expected end date in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- no expected end date

The CSV file does not include trainees who have deferred or withdrawn.

If a trainee’s expected end date is not in the period covered by the CSV file, you can choose to either:

- update their expected end date so that it’s in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- recommend them for QTS or EYTS from within their individual trainee record

### 3. Fill in the date when each trainee met QTS or EYTS standards

The CSV file has a blank column for you to fill in the date when trainees met the QTS or EYTS standards. This may be different to the date when they finish their course or get an academic qualification.

You can only bulk select trainees who met the QTS or EYTS requirements in the past 12 months. If a trainee met the requirement longer ago, you need to select them separately from within their trainee record.

If a trainee has not met the standards, you can choose to either:

- delete the row
- leave the date blank in the CSV file

Do not make any other changes to the CSV file.

### 4. Upload the CSV file and fix any errors

You’ll get an error message when you upload the CSV file if you:

- entered a date which cannot be accepted, such as a date in the future
- edited any data in the CSV (you cannot change trainee or course details using this process)

If there are any errors in the CSV file, you’ll be able to download a version showing the errors.

You can choose to either:

- fix the errors
- skip the errors and continue

If you skip the errors, you’ll only be able to select trainees whose data does not have errors. You can fix the errors later and select the trainees.

### 5. Submit your selection of trainees

After you submit your selection for trainees who hold QTS or EYTS, we will update our records to show they hold QTS or EYTS (where appropriate) within 3 working days.

The DfE will later send an email to the trainees to tell them that their certificates are available to download from the Access your Teacher Qualifications service.
