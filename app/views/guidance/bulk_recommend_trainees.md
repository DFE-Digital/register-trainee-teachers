You cannot use this process to indicate that trainees have withdrawn or deferred, or to make changes to trainee
records. You need to do this separately for each trainee.

You can also use the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) service if you have access to it. You cannot use it
 to indicate that trainees have deferred.

## How to bulk recommend trainees for QTS or EYTS

1. Download a CSV file listing trainees you can recommend for QTS or EYTS.
2. Fill in the date when each trainee met QTS or EYTS standards.
3. Upload the CSV file. If there are any errors, fix them and upload the file again.
4. Check the list of trainees you are going to recommend then submit your recommendations.

### 1. Download a CSV file listing trainees you can recommend for QTS or EYTS

The CSV file includes all trainees who have a TRN and either:

- an estimated end date in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- no estimated end date

If a trainee’s estimated end date is not in the period covered by the CSV file, you can either:

- update their estimated end date so that it’s in the past 6 months or the next 6 months
- recommend them for QTS or EYTS from within their record

### 2. Fill in the date when each trainee met QTS or EYTS standards

The CSV file has a blank column for you to fill in the date when trainees met QTS or EYTS standards. This may be
different to the date when they finish their course or get an academic qualification.

If a trainee has not met the standards, either delete the row or leave the date blank in the CSV file.

Do not make any other changes to the CSV file.

### 3. Upload the CSV file and fix any errors

You’ll get an error message when you upload the CSV file if you:

- entered a date which cannot be accepted, such as a date in the future
- edited any data in the CSV - you cannot change trainee or course details using this process

If there are any errors in the CSV file, you’ll be able to download a version showing the errors.

You can choose to either:
- fix the errors
- skip the errors and continue

If you skip the errors, you’ll only be able to recommend trainees whose data does not have errors. You can fix the
errors later and recommend the trainees.

### 4. Submit your recommendations

After you submit your recommendations, they’ll be immediately recommended for QTS or EYTS.
