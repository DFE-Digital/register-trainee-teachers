This guidance is for Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). 
 
There are instances when you might need to bulk download trainee’s teacher reference numbers (TRNs). This guidance will talk you through a step by step: 

- sign into [Register trainee teachers](https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/) 
- navigate to Registered trainees
- look for **Export these records**. You can use the filters on the left if you only want a selection of trainees
- a CSV file will download with all the trainee details including a column for TRN 

TRNs are often issued within a few hours of Registering a trainee. If a trainee has a tag that says Pending TRN to the right of their name, it means a TRN hasn’t been issued yet.
