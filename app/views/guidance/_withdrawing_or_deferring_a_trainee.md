## Withdraw or deferring a trainee

Once you’ve registered a trainee and they have started their training, you can withdraw or defer them. You can do this using the links on the trainee record in Register.

Trainees who are registered, but then do not start their ITT course at all, do not need to be withdrawn – their records can be deleted.
