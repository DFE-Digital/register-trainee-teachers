            Signing off your list of trainees for the initial teacher training census
        </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">Each year, as an accredited provider, you need to sign off your teacher trainee data in Register.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re in a partnership, you’re responsible for ensuring your lead partners’ trainee data is accurate and signed off by the deadline.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why the census sign-off is important</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">If your teacher trainee data is accurate and signed off by the deadline, it will help you:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>receive the correct amount of funding owed to you</li>
            <li>allocate the correct financial support to your trainees when they start their course, if applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your accurate census data also helps the DfE understand new entrants to teacher training in England for each academic year, and to inform future policy.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not sign off your data by the deadline, your organisation's data may not be included in the census publication.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking your trainee data in the 'Reports' section of Register</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Register all your new trainees for the current academic year, if you have not done so already. You can find out how to register trainees under the 'Registering trainees' section in the guidance.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can check your trainee data is correct by exporting your trainee records as a CSV file from the Reports section in Register. You should carefully check:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>number of trainees - if you have 'zero' or a lower number than you expect, check you've registered all your new trainees for the academic year</li>
            <li>courses - this may impact on any grants or bursaries trainees are able to receive</li>
            <li>start date - the correct start date will help trainees receive funding on time, if applicable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Signing off your trainee data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You will need to complete a form to sign off the data on behalf of your organisation.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>allocate time to check the accuracy of your trainee data</li>
            <li>confirm availability of your senior officer to sign off</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How your trainee data will be used</h2>
