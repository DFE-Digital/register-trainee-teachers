Training providers can register their trainees manually in the Register service by creating draft trainee records and adding the required data about your trainees.

Get prepared for adding a trainee record manually by [checking what data you need to provide](/guidance/check-data).

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How trainees are grouped on the Register homepage</h2>

When you log into Register, on the homepage you’ll see a section called ‘Draft trainees’ and a section called ‘Registered trainees’. Under ‘Registered trainees’ there are ‘training statuses’ where trainees are grouped by:

* course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started)
* in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred)
* currently deferred
* awarded this year (all trainees awarded QTS or EYTS in the current academic year)
* incomplete records (registered trainees that are missing data)

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting a teacher reference number (TRN)</h2>

Once a draft is complete, you can request a TRN for each trainee record. This is when the trainee becomes registered with the Department for Education.

Trainees will receive their TRN by email.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Trainee records imported from the Apply for teacher training (Apply) service</h2>

When an application reaches the ‘recruited’ status in Apply, it will be imported into Register. If an application has any conditions set, it will only reach recruited status in Apply once all conditions have been met.

Applications from Apply will import into Register every day at 4:00am. This is called the ‘Apply integration’.

An application imported from Apply into Register will become a draft trainee record. You can find these records on the homepage under ‘Draft trainees’ at the link called ‘View draft trainees imported from Apply’. You should not need to manually duplicate applications from Apply into Register.

On a trainee record from Apply, you’ll see:

* the course the trainee applied for
* the trainee’s personal details

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What to do with draft records from Apply</h3>

To register trainees that come from Apply, you’ll need to check if their data is correct and add any further data about their training. This can include:

* checking their course is correct (if their course has changed, you can update this in Register)
* fixing any mistakes that you know of
* providing any further training data like if the trainee will get funding or who their lead or employing school will be

Once an application is imported into Register, any changes you make to the application in Apply (after it’s in ‘recruited’ status) will not show in Register. Changes to trainee data in Register will also not reflect in Apply. At the moment, our integration only works to bring applications into Register.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking your trainee data to make sure it’s correct</h2>

There are 3 ways to do this in Register and you can choose whichever one suits you. These are:

* using the new ‘Reports’ section and exporting a CSV of your new trainees for the 2022 to 2023 academic year
* exporting a CSV of your trainees in the ‘Registered trainees’ section, using the ‘start year’ filter to select the current academic year
* checking your trainees directly in the service one by one

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Adding specific information to a trainee record</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Physical education with EBacc</h3>

Follow these steps to register a trainee on a physical education with EBacc course:

1. Add physical education as the first subject.
2. Add the EBacc subject they are studying as the second subject, for example biology.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Recommending a trainee for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)</h2>

When a trainee has successfully completed their training (or completed their assessment for an ‘assessment only’ route) and met the required standards, you can recommend them for QTS or EYTS in Register.

If the trainee’s record is incomplete (there is missing information), the button will not appear, but there will be a prompt to guide you to add the missing information before you can recommend the trainee.
