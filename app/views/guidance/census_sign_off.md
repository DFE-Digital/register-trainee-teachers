Each year you need to sign off your list of trainee teachers in Register. You must now sign off trainee data for the 2023 to 2024 academic year.

## Why the census sign-off is important

If your teacher trainee data is accurate and signed off by 31 October 2023, it will help you:

* receive the correct amount of funding owed to you
* allocate the correct financial support to your trainees when they start their course, if applicable

Your accurate census data also helps the DfE understand new entrants to teacher training in England for the 2023 to 2024 academic year, and to inform future policy.

If you do not sign off your data by 31 October, your organisations data may not be included in the census publication.

## Checking your trainee data in the 'Reports' section of Register

Register all your new trainees for the 2023 to 2024 academic year, if you have not done so already. You can find out how to register trainees under the 'Registering trainees' section in the guidance.

You can check your trainee data is correct by exporting your trainee records as a CSV file from the Reports section in Register. You should carefully check:

* number of trainees - if you have 'zero' or a lower number than you expect, check you've registered all your new trainees for the 2023 to 2024 academic year
* courses - this may impact on any grants or bursaries trainees are able to receive
* start date - the correct start date will help trainees receive funding on time, if applicable

## Signing off your trainee data

A senior person from your organisation will need to complete <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/kzBmEWKDGz" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this form to sign off the data (opens in new window).</a>

This must not be the same person who entered, checked and updated the data.

## Before you start

You should:

* allocate time to check the accuracy of your trainee data
* confirm availability of your senior officer to sign off &mdash; do not leave this to the last week in October

## How your trainee data will be used

Read the [Initial Teacher Training census methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census-methodology) to find out how your trainee data will be used.
