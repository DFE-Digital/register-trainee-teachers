<p class='govuk-body'>
  This data sharing agreement (DSA) applies to personal data
  shared between the Department for Education (DfE) and (‘the
  provider’) as part of the <span class='app-nowrap'>Register
  trainee teachers</span> (Register) service.
</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m' id='#the-aims-and-benefits-of-the-data-sharing-initiative'>
  The aims and benefits of the data sharing agreement
</h2>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  The aim of this data sharing agreement is to enable the parties to
  understand how data is collected, processed and managed in Register.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  This data sharing agreement sets out your roles, responsibilities,
  and accountability as Data Controller for the different processing of
  the personal data that is stored and processed in Register.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  Register has replaced the existing Database of Trainee Teachers and
  Providers (DTTP). The DTTP service existed to support the exchange of
  data on trainee teachers in England between accredited Initial
  Teacher Training (ITT) Providers and the DfE. Trainee teacher data is
  a critical business requirement with accredited providers entering
  data into the DTTP, and that data being used by internal downstream
  users.
</p>
<h2 class='govuk-heading-m' id='#the-agreed-purposes'>
  The agreed purposes
</h2>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  This collection and processing of this data is vital to DfE for a
  variety of purposes including (but not limited to):
</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>collection of data for statistics and publications</li>
  <li>assessing the impact of teacher recruitment campaigns</li>
  <li>calculation and allocation of funding for bursaries, scholarships and grants</li>
  <li>auditing of third party teaching suppliers</li>
  <li>awarding of teacher status at the end of a trainee’s teacher training</li>
  <li>creating a trainee’s teacher record once they qualify, which is used throughout their teaching career</li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  This data provides the DfE with past, current, and future foresight
  of new teachers entering the workforce.

  information.
</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>
  Identifiable data of providers
</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  There are various combinations of identifiable data which may be
  collected about a provider (depending on route), these extend to:
</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>training partner ID</li>

  Independent Data Controllers for the trainee’s data. It is the
  provider’s responsibility as an Independent Data Controller to
  ensure compliance with the appropriate requirements of data
  protection legislation.
</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>
  Register trainee teachers privacy notice
</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  In situations where a trainee did not use
  <a class='govuk-link'
    href='https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training'>Apply
    for teacher training</a> (Apply),
  the accredited provider should inform their
  trainees of Register’s privacy notice which describes to
  trainees how their data will be used. This privacy notice will
  include the email address they can use to contact the Register
  support team, and can be found at
  <a class='govuk-link' href='https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/privacy-notice'>www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/privacy-notice</a>
</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>
  What the provider can use personal data for that’s shared with
  them by the DfE
</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  Part of the data that the DfE collects for each trainee includes
  sensitive data, as described above. Where trainee data comes in
  through Apply the accredited provider is responsible for correcting
  and updating the data in Register on behalf of the trainee.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  When data is directly entered into Register, the accredited provider
  collects this information from the trainee and enters it into
  Register manually and keeps it up to date. The accredited providers
  remain Data Controllers as they need this data for their student
  records.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  When training partners import Register’s data they have an obligation to
  ensure the data is used in accordance with the rules stated in the
  Third party section of this document.
</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>
  What the DfE can use personal data shared with the DfE for
</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  Register receives the data outlined in this section from Apply
  (internal to the DfE) or the accredited providers. This data is used
  to allocate a Teacher reference number (TRN) and Qualified teacher
  status (QTS) or Early years teacher status (EYTS) to the trainee by
  the DfE, and for the purposes of preventing duplication in the
  allocation process.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  Additionally, statistical analysis is done by the DfE to understand
  demographic trends in and performance of teacher recruitment. Once a
  TRN is allocated for the trainee and a QTS or EYTS is awarded, these
  are passed onto the providers for their student records. The data is
  also included in the trainee’s teacher record throughout their
  career.
</p>
<h2 class='govuk-heading-m' id='#lawful-basis'>
  Lawful basis
</h2>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  The data collected by Register provides the DfE with past, current,
  and future foresight of new teachers entering the workforce. This
  data collection and processing operates under the Secretary of State
  for Education’s ministerial common law powers. The DfE and providers
  commit to working together to limit the personal data shared and
  reduce this where possible. The following statutes underpinned the
  basis for processing this data.
</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  The lawful basis for this processing is Public Interest, as outlined
  in the legislation:
</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>Article 6(1)(e) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)</li>
  <li>Section 8(d) of the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018: <a class='govuk-link'
      href='https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/8'>UK
      DPA Legislation</a></li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>
  The lawful basis for processing Special Category Data is Substantial
  Public Interest, as outlined in the legislation:
</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>Article 9(2)(g) of the UK GDPR</li>
  <li>Data Protection Act 2018 - Schedule 1: Part 2; <a class='govuk-link'

  <p class='govuk-body'>
    <a class='govuk-link' href='/privacy-notice'>Refer
    to the Register privacy notice</a> to see how Register handles
    data entered directly into the service.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    In a situation where trainee records are entered directly into
    Register for non Apply trainees, the provider should inform their
    trainees of Register’s own privacy notice which describes to
    trainees how their data will be used. This privacy notice will
    include the email address they can use to contact the Register
    support team.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    It is the responsibility of providers, as Data Controllers, to
    ensure that their respective privacy notices are sufficiently
    detailed to cover the data sharing activity specified in this DSA,
    including but not limited to the Purpose and the Lawful Basis for
    the sharing and processing.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    By agreeing to this data sharing agreement, the DfE and the
    provider confirm that their respective privacy notices explain the
    data sharing activities outlined in this agreement.

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m' id='#data-handling'>
  Data handling
</h2>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    The DfE and the providers are Independent Data Controllers for the data collected through Register. The primary routes which data enters Register through are:
  </p>
  <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
    <li>
      Providers send data over the Register API using data collected from their own systems to populate Register.
    </li>
    <li>
      Providers bulk upload data using CSV bulk add new trainee using data collected from their own systems to populate Register.
    </li>
    <li>
      Register using an API to pull data where providers have managed
      the application process (with trainees submitting their data via
      the Apply service). Accredited providers may still need to add
      course details into these pre-populated records
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    The systems-based connection in which Register may share data:
  </p>
  <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
    <li>
      Register connects to Apply to retrieve applicant information to
      populate its own records
    </li>
    <li>
      Register retrieves course information from the Publish teacher
      training (Publish) service
    </li>
    <li>
      organisations connect to Register to add, view or update their
      trainee data. Users can only access data connected to their
      organisation
    </li>
    <li>
      Register reads and writes trainee record data to systems within
      the DfE for the purpose of allocating or retrieving a TRN for
      trainees and for registering their QTS or EYTS.
    </li>
    <li>
      training partners connect to Register to view their funding
      information and trainees’ information
    </li>
    <li>
      When the Register API is used, personal data may be transferred from the system where the provider stores it to the DfE Register. The provider confirms that they are the independent controller of that data. They also confirm that they have the right to allow the transfer of the data. This includes transfers from any third-party system used to store the data, through the Register API, to the DfE Register. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    The DfE uses <a class='govuk-link'
    href='https://www.zendesk.co.uk/company/privacy-and-data-protection/#faq-general-1'>
    Zendesk</a>, a customer relationship management system, to
    handle queries from provider staff.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    For data concerning trainees provided to the DfE by users through
    Zendesk, providers continue to be Data Controllers. The DfE will
    use this data for analytical purposes as well as for supporting
    providers with their queries and therefore will also become Data
    Controller at this point for this data.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    The DfE and the provider may use some personal data such as names
    and date of birth for identification purposes through other
    channels, such as by phone or email for support and administration
    purposes.
