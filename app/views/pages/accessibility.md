This accessibility statement applies to Register trainee teachers.

This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

  - change colours, contrast levels and fonts
  - zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
  - navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
  - navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
  - listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.
<a href='https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/' class='govuk-link' rel='noreferrer noopener' target="_blank">AbilityNet (opens in new tab)</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this service is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

  - some of our forms do not provide suggestions on how to rectify information that has been input incorrectly
  - unsupported ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used on some form inputs
  - error messages are announced twice to users of JAWS (Job Access With Speech)
  - files cannot be uploaded whilst navigating with speech recognition software

## Technical information about this service’s accessibility

The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.2 AA standard, due to the following non-compliances (and/or) the following exemptions.

## Non-accessible content

The content is non-accessible for the following reasons:

### Specific error suggestions are not provided for some fields on forms

This can be seen on date fields, if the user inputs an incorrectly formatted date, the error message does not provide a suggestion on how to rectify it. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.1 Error Identification.

We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.

### Unsupported ARIA attributes are present on some form inputs

This may cause issues for users of assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.

We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.

### While navigating with JAWS, parts of error messages are announced multiple times

This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 Name. Role, Value.

We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.

## Disproportionate burden

We have determined that there is a disproportionate burden to meet all the requirements for the following reasons:

### Interactive tools

The upload file function is unavailable whilst navigating using speech recognition software. This is a known flaw of speech recognition software.

We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the navigation issues and accessing information, and the costs associated with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that proceeding with these changes now would place a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">disproportionate burden (opens in new tab)</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will conduct another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely in 2026.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We have created a backlog of tickets for ongoing accessibility improvements. We conduct regular user testing and audits. We will continue to use the accessibility manual to enhance knowledge within the team and resolve accessibility issues when identified.
