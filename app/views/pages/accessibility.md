<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Enforcement procedure</h2>
<p class='govuk-body'>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href='https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/' class='govuk-link' target="_blank">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>

<p class='govuk-body'>The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Compliance status</h2>

<p class='govuk-body'>This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.2 AA standard, due to the following non-compliances (and/or) the following exemptions.</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Non-accessible content</h2>

<p class='govuk-body'>The content is non-accessible for the following reasons:</p>

<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

<p class='govuk-body'>Specific error suggestions are not provided for some fields on forms. This can be seen on date fields, if the user inputs an incorrectly formatted date, the error message does not provide a suggestion on how to rectify it. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.1 Error Identification.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>Unsupported ARIA attributes are present on some form inputs. This may cause issues for users of assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>While navigating with JAWS, parts of error messages are announced multiple times. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 Name. Role, Value.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>We’re waiting on third parties to assist with remediation so a fix date cannot be provided.</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Disproportionate burden</h2>

<p class='govuk-body'>We have determined that there is a disproportionate burden to meet all the requirements for the following reasons:

<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>Interactive tools</h3>

<p class='govuk-body'>The upload file function is unavailable whilst navigating using speech recognition software. This is a known flaw of speech recognition software.</p>

<p class='govuk-body'>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the navigation issues and accessing information, as well as the costs associated with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that proceeding with these changes now would place a <a class='govuk-link' href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" target="_blank">disproportionate burden (opens in a new tab)</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will conduct another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely in 2026.</p>

<h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
<p class='govuk-body'>We have a backlog of tickets created for ongoing accessibility improvements. We conduct regular user testing and audits. We will continue to use the accessibility manual to enhance knowledge within the team and resolve accessibility issues when identified.</p>
