        You cannot add new trainees if there is an error in their row in the CSV file.
        In order to add new trainees, the errors will need to be fixed.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        A spreadsheet program can be used to fix the errors in the CSV file.
        Sometimes spreadsheet programs can change the way data is imported into a CSV which causes errors. For example, dates can be reformatted into dd/mm/yy format.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You may notice that apostrophes have been added to some values in the CSV
        e.g. '2025-06-06. These are intentional and shouldnâ€™t be removed. Leave them in
        place when you fix the errors in the CSV file. They will be automatically
        removed when you upload the CSV file again.
