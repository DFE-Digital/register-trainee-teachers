# Azure Terraform Module

## Temporary Data Storage Account

The following code defines the Terraform code that creates the temporary data storage account.
This is commented out because the CI pipeline service principal does not have sufficient permission
to create Azure resources at present but we wanted to document the temporary data storage account
in Terraform for when we migrate the service away from GOV.UK PaaS.
