  title: April HESA census update extended to Friday 13 May 2022
  content: |
    The import from HESA to Register is ongoing. This means if you’re a Higher Education Institute (HEI) of Initial Teacher Training (ITT), you can update and upload data to HESA, but you cannot see this update on Register yet. We’ve extended the deadline for the April census update from 29 April to Friday 13 May.

    We will update you when your data is visible to check on Register.

  content: |
    At 5pm on 28 March 2022, DTTP will no longer be available. From this date, there will be no access to DTTP and you should use Register for all actions previously performed on DTTP.

    There will be two days of downtime from 29 to 30 March when trainee data will not be available on either DTTP or Register. From 31 March, all trainee data from 2020 to 2021 onwards will be available in Register. Earlier trainees, who are not marked as having left, will also be available in Register.

  title: When you need to provide trainee start dates has changed
  content: |
    When registering a trainee, we were always asking when the trainee started, even if their course had not started.
    Now, we will only ask when the trainee started, after their course has started.

    You’ll need to provide a start date before you can recommend a trainee for QTS or EYTS.

  title: You no longer need to provide a lead or employing school for trainees who are employed or funded privately
  content: |
    When you’re registering a trainee, we were asking for a lead or employing school in all cases. If a trainee is
    employed or funded privately, we do not need this information so we’ve added a ‘not applicable’ option to the lead
    and employing schools sections. You do not need to provide lead or employing schools if the trainee is employed or
    funded privately.
