  content: |
    These are changes to the trainee data fields when submitting directly to Register via the ‘Bulk add new trainees’ CSV template or the API, for the upcoming 2025 to 2026 academic year.

      <ul>
          <li>COURSEID or CTITLE do not need to be provided</li>
          <li>Degree type is now required for non-UK previous degrees — use the ‘non-UK degree type’ field and the HESA DEGTYPE reference codes</li>
          <li>‘UK degree grade’ for trainees with previous qualifications:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>API - you should add all multiple previous qualifications</li>
            <li>CSV template – you should only use their highest-level previous qualification</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

  title: Updating how you recommend trainees for qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS)
  content: |
    We’ve updated the way you recommend trainees for QTS or EYTS in Register trainee teachers (Register).

    Your trainees’ degree fields in Register are now ‘mandatory’. You must submit accurate data into these fields before you can recommend your trainees for QTS or EYTS.

    This update applies when you recommend a trainee within their trainee record, and when you recommend multiple trainees at the same time, using the bulk recommend tool.

    If you need help meeting these requirements, email us at <a class='govuk-link' href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.

  title: Get ready to submit your school placements data in Register
  content: |
    You’ll be asked to include school placement data in the next performance profiles sign off in Register.

    The next performance profile sign off period will start in December 2023 with a deadline of 31 January 2024.

    You’ll be asked to sign off performance profile data for registered trainees with a course outcome in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

    <h3>Type of placement data you must have in Register</h3>

    Each trainee with a course outcome in the 2022 to 2023 academic year must have a minimum of 2 school placements.

    You’ll need to check you have the placement school URN, if known, otherwise the school name and postcode.

    <h3>Next steps for SCITT training providers</h3>

    If you keep a separate list or spread sheet of school placement information, make sure you include the school’s Unique Reference Number (URN).

    If you do not have the URN, you’ll need the school or setting name and postcode.

    <h3>Next steps for HEI training providers</h3>

    We’ll import the URN for all HEI trainee placements from the student collection into Register so that you do not have to re-key this information again.

    We aim to complete this by late December 2023. You do not have to do anything at this stage.

    You’ll be contacted by early January 2024 to let you know when the import is complete. You can then:

      <ul>
          <li>check for any gaps in your placement information in Register</li>
          <li>update any missing placement information in Register</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Why collecting placements data is important</h3>

    Trainee teachers need varied classroom experience and must have taught classes to pupils in two schools prior to the award of Qualified Teacher Status. This is called ‘placements’.

    If we collect placement data in one place, we can analyse and use it to inform policy decisions, and help providers find placements more efficiently and effectively.
