  title: ‘Reports’ section is now available in Register to help check your data before signing it off
  content: |
     To help training providers check their data before the sign off deadline on 31 October 2022, we’ve created a new ‘Reports’ section. You can access this from the main navigation bar under ‘Reports’.
    
     Once you’ve registered your new trainees and their data is in Register, you’ll be able to use the ‘Reports’ section to export your new trainee data into a CSV. This will help you check your data is correct for trainees starting in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

  title: Create draft trainee records in Register for the 2022 to 2023 academic year
  content: |
     SCITTs, and HEIs with trainees that do not go through HESA, can now start creating draft trainee records in Register for the 2022 to 2023 academic year. You can either register your trainees immediately or wait, and register them closer to the start of their course.
    
     Applications from Apply for teacher training (Apply) with a ‘recruited’ status will also be imported into Register as draft records. Applications will import into Register every day at 4:00am. You should not need to manually duplicate applications from Apply into Register.

  title: Update your initial teacher training (ITT) data through HESA from 18 to 29 July 2022
  content: |
     If you’re a higher education institute (HEI), you can start updating your trainee data through HESA from 18 to 29 July.
    
     You’ll first need to have your data decommitted in HESA. Email our support team who will decommit your data and let you know when it’s ready to update. Email us at [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Decommit%20trainee%20data%20in%20HESA%20for%20July%20update%20period).

  title: Improvements to Register’s homepage and filters
  content: |
    We’ve improved our homepage designs and the way you can filter trainee records. On the homepage, under ‘Registered trainees’, you’ll see trainees are grouped by ‘training status’, which include:
      <ul>
        <li>course not started yet (trainees who are registered but their course has not started)</li>
        <li>in training (all trainees currently doing training, excluding those on courses that have not started or are deferred)</li>
        <li>currently deferred</li>
        <li>awarded this year (all trainees awarded QTS or EYTS in the current academic year)</li>
        <li>incomplete records (registered trainees that are missing data)</li>
      </ul>
    We’ve also included a new filter called ‘End year’, which shows all trainees that will finish or have finished in a given academic year. This is so you can easily find past trainee records if you need to, but they will not interfere with records of trainees who are still training.

     Accredited providers will see funding paid and predicted to be paid for scholarships and bursaries. Lead schools will see funding paid and predicted to be paid for salary grants.

    The import from HESA to Register is working normally. This means if you’re a Higher Education Institute (HEI), you can use Register to see data that you have updated and uploaded to HESA. This will allow you to complete your April census update by 13 May.

    If you have updated any data about placements in HESA, you will not be able to see this in Register yet, but this will be available in future. If you identify any further issues with your data, contact [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=HESA%20import%20issues%20in%20Register).

  title: DTTP switch off and transition to Register
  content: |
    At 5pm on 28 March 2022, DTTP will no longer be available. From this date, there will be no access to DTTP and you should use Register for all actions previously performed on DTTP.

    There will be two days of downtime from 29 to 30 March when trainee data will not be available on either DTTP or Register. From 31 March, all trainee data from 2020 to 2021 onwards will be available in Register. Earlier trainees, who are not marked as having left, will also be available in Register.

  title: When you need to provide trainee start dates has changed
  content: |
    When registering a trainee, we were always asking when the trainee started, even if their course had not started.
    Now, we will only ask when the trainee started, after their course has started.

    You’ll need to provide a start date before you can recommend a trainee for QTS or EYTS.

  title: You no longer need to provide a lead or employing school for trainees who are employed or funded privately
  content: |
    When you’re registering a trainee, we were asking for a lead or employing school in all cases. If a trainee is
    employed or funded privately, we do not need this information so we’ve added a ‘not applicable’ option to the lead
    and employing schools sections. You do not need to provide lead or employing schools if the trainee is employed or
    funded privately.
