        <p class='govuk-body'>This accessibility statement applies to Register trainee teachers.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:</p>
        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
          <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
          <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
          <li>listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='govuk-body'>We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>

        <p class='govuk-body'>The Becoming a Teacher team is committed to making Register trainee teachers accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

        <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Compliance status</h2>

        <p class='govuk-body'>This service is partially compliant with the <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/' class='govuk-link'>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (level AA)</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

        <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Non-accessible content</h2>

        <p class='govuk-body'>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

        <h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

        <p class='govuk-body'>To disable auto-fill on text inputs, we need to set the autocomplete attribute to a non-standard value. This fails <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html' class='govuk-link'> WCAG 1.3.5: Identify Input Purpose</a>.</p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>Auto-fill is not suitable for Register trainee teachers and makes the task of registering trainee teachers more difficult.</p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>We believe the impact of a non-standard value is minimal and the value of disabling auto-fill is much greater. The fail is unlikely to impact our users and will benefit many of them.</p>
