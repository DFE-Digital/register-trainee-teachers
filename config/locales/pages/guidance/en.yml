      <p class='govuk-body'>Register trainee teachers is the service that will eventually replace the Database of Trainee Teachers &amp; Providers (DTTP) portal.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Accredited Initial Teacher Training (ITT) providers use it to provide DfE with their trainee data.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Training providers can also perform tasks on behalf of their trainees within Register.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Those tasks include withdrawing, deferring, getting teacher reference numbers (TRN) and recommending for qualified teacher status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS).</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>DfE also uses the data for funding, the ITT census and analysis to inform policy development.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Adding trainee records</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>You can add a trainee record manually, which means that you input all of the required data from your own records.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Get prepared for adding a trainee record manually by <a class='govuk-link' href='/check-data'>checking what data you need to provide</a>.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Register is linked to the DfE's Apply for teacher training service, which means that all trainee records created in Apply will be imported into Register. This is called ‘Apply integration’.</p>

      <h4 class='govuk-heading-s'>Apply integration</h4>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Register imports all records from Apply that have met the conditions and have the status ‘Recruited’.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>The records from Apply will be ‘drafts’ in Register. You'll need to check them before registering.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>You may need to amend some fields if they’re not right or things have changed - these will be highlighted in Register. For example, you may need to change the course.</p>

      <h4 class='govuk-heading-s'>PE with EBacc</h4>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Follow these steps to register a trainee doing PE with EBacc:</p>

      <ol class='govuk-list govuk-list--number'>
        <li>Add a first subject as PE, or a PE based subject.</li>
        <li>Add a second subject as their EBacc subject.</li>
        <li>Email us at <a class='govuk-notification-banner__link' href='mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk'>becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a> stating their trainee ID and that they are doing PE with EBacc.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Getting a teacher reference number (TRN)</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>When you’ve added a trainee into Register the first action you can take is to request a TRN for the trainee. This is when the trainee becomes registered with the Department for Education.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Every teacher has a TRN and it stays with them throughout their career. It appears on their payslips and pension statements.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>They also use it to access the teacher self service portal where they can view their teacher record, view their qualifications and update personal details.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>When you’ve requested a TRN, Register will usually be updated with the TRN within 3 working days.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Assessment only candidates will usually receive an email with their TRN. For all other routes, trainees will receive a letter. This means trainees may contact you to find out their TRN.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Recommending a trainee for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) or Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS)</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>When a trainee has successfully completed their training (or completed their assessement for AO) and met the required standards, you can recommend them for QTS or EYTS in Register.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>DfE will usually award QTS or EYTS within 3 days.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Withdraw and defer</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Once you’ve registered a trainee, you can withdraw or defer them. You can do this using the links on the trainee record.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Funding</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>For the ITT routes where funding applies, the data supports bursaries and scholarships, for example, it’s used to provide accurate funding to training providers.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>It’s used for the funding of grants on the School direct salaried route. It also provides evidence for DfE when its finances are audited.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Census</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>DfE publishes an annual census of trainee teachers who are starting their training. This is so we have an indication of who will be entering the teaching workforce and can plan teacher recruitment activity.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>The census happens in September and October every year. We‘ll notify you about the exact dates each year, including the deadline when your data needs to be signed off by a responsible officer.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>To sign your organisation‘s data off, the responsible officer needs to email us at <a class='govuk-notification-banner__link' href='mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk'>becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>The subject line must state ‘Census 2021 to 2022’ and the name of your organisation.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>In the body of the email, state the following:</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>‘I confirm that the Census data for the trainees who started their ITT in 2021 to 2022 is complete and accurate for my organisation as of the date of this email. The Census data is signed-off by (insert the responsible officer‘s name).’
      </p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Profiles (outcomes)</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>DfE publishes data on how many people have successfully completed their training each year.</p>
