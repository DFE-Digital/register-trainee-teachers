          The aims and benefits of the data sharing agreement
        </h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The aim of this data sharing agreement is to enable the parties to
          understand how data is collected, processed and managed in Register.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          This data sharing agreement sets out your roles, responsibilities,
          and accountability as Data Controller for the different processing of
          the personal data that is stored and processed in Register.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Register has replaced the existing Database of Trainee Teachers and
          Providers (DTTP). The DTTP service existed to support the exchange of
          data on trainee teachers in England between accredited Initial
          Teacher Training (ITT) Providers and the DfE. Trainee teacher data is
          a critical business requirement with accredited providers entering
          data into the DTTP, and that data being used by internal downstream
          users.

        <p class='govuk-body'>
          At the point of data collection, the DfE and the providers are
          Independent Data Controllers for the trainee’s data. It is the
          provider’s responsibility as an Independent Data Controller to
          ensure compliance with the appropriate requirements of data
          protection legislation.

          In situations where a trainee did not use
          <a class='govuk-link'
            href='https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training'>Apply
            for teacher training</a> (Apply),
          the accredited provider should inform their
          trainees of Register’s privacy notice which describes to
          trainees how their data will be used. This privacy notice will
          include the email address they can use to contact the Register
          support team, and can be found at
          <a class='govuk-link' href='https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/privacy-notice'>www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/privacy-notice</a>

          What the provider can use personal data for that’s shared with
          them by the DfE
        </h3>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Part of the data that the DfE collects for each trainee includes
          sensitive data, as described above. Where trainee data comes in
          through Apply the accredited provider is responsible for correcting
          and updating the data in Register on behalf of the trainee.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          When data is directly entered into Register, the accredited provider
          collects this information from the trainee and enters it into
          Register manually and keeps it up to date. The accredited providers
          remain Data Controllers as they need this data for their student
          records.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          When lead schools import Register’s data they have an obligation to
          ensure the data is used in accordance with the rules stated in the
          Third party section of this document.
        </p>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>
          What the DfE can use personal data shared with the DfE for
        </h3>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Register receives the data outlined in this section from Apply
          (internal to the DfE) or the accredited providers. This data is used
          to allocate a Teacher reference number (TRN) and Qualified teacher
          status (QTS) or Early years teacher status (EYTS) to the trainee by
          the DfE, and for the purposes of preventing duplication in the
          allocation process. 
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Additionally, statistical analysis is done by the DfE to understand
          demographic trends in and performance of teacher recruitment. Once a
          TRN is allocated for the trainee and a QTS or EYTS is awarded, these
          are passed onto the providers for their student records. The data is
          also included in the trainee’s teacher record throughout their
          career.
        </p>
        <h2 class='govuk-heading-m' id='#lawful-basis'>
          Lawful basis
        </h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The data collected by Register provides the DfE with past, current,
          and future foresight of new teachers entering the workforce. This
          data collection and processing operates under the Secretary of State
          for Education’s ministerial common law powers. The DfE and providers
          commit to working together to limit the personal data shared and
          reduce this where possible. The following statutes underpinned the
          basis for processing this data.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The lawful basis for this processing is Public Interest, as outlined
          in the legislation:
