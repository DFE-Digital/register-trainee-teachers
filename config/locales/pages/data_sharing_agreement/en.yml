          Data sharing details

        <p class='govuk-body'>
          This data sharing agreement (DSA) applies to personal data
          shared between the Department Education (DfE) and (‘the

          The aims and benefits of the data sharing agreement
        </h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The parties consider this data sharing agreement necessary as
          it will enable the parties to understand how effectively data
          collected and processed as part of Register is managed.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          This data sharing agreement sets out your roles,
          responsibility, and accountability as Data Controller for the
          different processing of the personal data that is stored and
          processed in Register.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Register will replace the existing Database of Trainee
          Teachers and Providers (DTTP). The DTTP service exists to
          support the exchange of data on trainee teachers in England
          between accredited Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Providers
          and the DfE. Trainee teacher data is a critical business
          requirement with Providers entering data into the DTTP and
          that data being used by internal downstream users.

          be collected about a provider (depending on route), these extend

          At the point of data collection, the DfE and the providers are
          Independent Data Controllers for the trainee’s data. It is the
          provider’s responsibility as an Independent Data Controller to
          ensure compliance with the appropriate requirements of data
          protection legislation.

          trainees of Register’s privacy notice which describes to
          trainees how their data will be used. This privacy notice will
          include the email address they can use to contact the Register
          support team, and can be found at

        </h3>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Part of the data that the DfE collects for each trainee
          includes sensitive data, as described above. Where trainee
          data comes in through Apply the provider is responsible for
          correcting and updating the data in Register on behalf of the
          trainee.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          When the data comes through direct entry into Register, the
          provider collects this information from the trainee and enters
          it into Register manually and keeps it up to date. The
          providers remain Data Controllers as they need this data for
          their student records.

          What the DfE can use personal data shared with the DfE for
        </h3>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          Register receives the data outlined in this section from Apply
          (internal to the DfE) or the providers. This data is used to
          allocate a Teacher reference number (TRN) and Qualified
          teacher status (QTS) or Early years teacher status (EYTS) to
          the trainee by the DfE, and for the purposes of preventing
          duplication in the allocation process. Additionally,
          statistical analysis is done by the DfE to understand
          demographic trends in and performance of teacher recruitment.
          Once a TRN is allocated for the trainee and a QTS or EYTS is
          awarded, these are passed onto the providers for their student
          records.

          In the event of a personal data breach (or where there is a
          reason to believe that an incident could arise) the DfE and
          the provider will pause further data sharing until the
          signatories of this agreement are satisfied that the cause or
          incident is resolved.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          If the issue cannot be resolved or if it’s very serious,
          data sharing will not start again until DfE and the provider
          are satisfied that the cause or incident is resolved.
        </p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The DfE contact would raise the incident with the DfE
