# Register API documentation

<%= partial "partials/hei_only_warning" %>

This is Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for the Department for Education (DfE)’s Register
trainee teachers (Register) service.

The Register API has replaced the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) service for teacher trainees from the
2025/26 collection cycle. All vendors of student record systems (SRS) and some
training providers will need to make changes to integrate with Register.

## What this API is for

The Register API allows providers to import trainee records from their student
record systems and to keep those records synchronised as they are modified.

Providers can use the API for:

* looking up a trainee record in Register and returning details about that trainee
* retrieving a list of trainee records in Register for a given academic year
* creating new trainee records
* updating individual trainee records
* withdrawing and deferring a trainee

## How do I connect to this API?

### Authentication and authorisation

Requests to the API must be accompanied by an authentication token.

Each token is associated with a single provider. It will grant access to trainee records registered by that provider.

You can get a token by following these steps:

1. Log into your account at https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/
2. Navigate to Organisation settings in the top right of your screen.
3. Find Manage your tokens.
4. Generate or revoke tokens from this page.

For instructions on how to authenticate, see the [API reference](/api-docs/v2025.0/developing-on-the-api.html#authentication).

## Design principles

### Trainee identifiers
Trainees are identified in the API by an internally generated unique `id`
value. The API uses the `id` to specify a particular trainee record. For
example, the API endpoint that updates a single trainee record requires that
`id` value as part of its URL.

For example, the following request updates the trainee record identified by `id` value
`gQGecNYwLCqPMTgzW7N2bURi`.

```
PUT https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/api/v2025.0/trainees/gQGecNYwLCqPMTgzW7N2bURi
```

You can obtain `id` values from the following request which returns the list of
trainees for the current provider:

```
GET https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/api/v2025.0/trainees
```

Alternatively an `id` value is given as part of the response to a request to create a new trainee record:

```
POST https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/api/v2025.0/trainees
```

## Reference data and data encoding
Trainee records have a number of attributes that refer to reference data of
various sorts. For example, we record the nationality of trainees.

This section provides guidance on how those attributes are serialised in the
requests and responses processed by the API.

For more information about reference data you can visit the [reference data documentation](/reference-data/).

### Dates
All dates and datetimes in the API specification are intended to be [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
compliant.

### Nationalities
Nationality is expressed as an [ISO 3166-2](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country code.

### Degrees
A list of valid values for the subject, degree type, institution and grade
attributes can be obtained from the reference data endpoint. Details are
provided in the [API reference](/api-docs/v2025.0/contents.html).

### Placements
Placement schools are identified by their URN (unique reference number).

## API versioning strategy

When we provide new features through the API, we sometimes make changes that
require you to update student record systems.

We give a new number to the new version of the API. The change of version
number shows whether we’ve made breaking or non-breaking changes to the API.

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes usually involve modifying or deleting parts of the API, such as:

* removing features
* removing fields
* changing the behaviour of endpoints, for example requiring a new parameter
* in order for data to be synced

You must update student record systems before you move to a new version with
breaking changes.

### Non-breaking changes

When we make non-breaking changes the API remains ‘backward compatible’. This
means that the changes do not affect the existing functionality of the API.

Non-breaking changes include adding new:

* endpoints, for example to allow a new action to be performed on a trainee record
* nested resources and objects, for example details of a trainee’s placements
* fields, for example when a reason for a deferral is added
* optional query parameters, for example to allow optional pagination when data is synced

You do not need to update student record systems before moving to a new version
with non-breaking changes. You only need to make updates if you want to use the
version’s new features.

### How the API version number reflects the changes we’ve made

We use an academic-year-based Calendar Versioning ([CalVer](https://calver.org/) variant).

The format is `YYYY.MAJOR` (for example, `2025.1`) where `YYYY` is the year that
the version enters production and `MAJOR` is the major version number.

`MAJOR` will increment for breaking changes. Non-breaking changes are included within the
current version.

Pre-release versions are suffixed with `-pre` and release candidate versions
(no changes expected before go-live) are suffixed with `-rc`.

Changes are documented in our [release notes](/api-docs/release-notes.html).

### Using the correct version of the API

When an API version is released, version updates will be made available on their own
version URL.

For example, after version `2025.2` is released you can use:

* https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/api/v2025.1 for version `2025.1`
* https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/api/v2025.2 for version `2025.2`

## Testing

To get familiar with our system and perform testing, you can use
[our sandbox environment](https://sandbox.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/).

You will need an [authentication token](/api-docs/v2025.0/developing-on-the-api.html#authentication)
for the sandbox environment. These will be provided by the Register team.
