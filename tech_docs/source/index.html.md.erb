# Hello, World!

## Edit Me!

Open `source/documentation/index.md` in your favourite text editor and start editing!

You can write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using **all** of the _usual_ syntax that you're used to!

To change the title of the page or include additional files you'll need to edit `source/index.html.md.erb`.

If you want slightly more control, you can always use <strong>HTML</strong>.

For more detail and troubleshooting, take a look at the `README.md` file in the root of this project.
