# How the API works

Use this section to explain how your API works conceptually, if your API is complicated and users must:

- understand and use a sequence of API requests and responses
- understand how different backend systems interact

Only include this section if you’ve discovered a need for it in your research and tested it thoroughly. This is because conceptual information can:

- get in the way of developers finding the task-based guidance they’re looking for
- be ignored or only partially read by developers

You should write this section as an explanation of flow or a sequence of steps, using numbered steps if possible. For example, see [How the Document Checking Service works](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/integrating-with-the-dcs/#how-the-dcs-works) or [How GOV.UK Pay works](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/payment_flow/#how-gov-uk-pay-works).
