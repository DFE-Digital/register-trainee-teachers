# Test your integration

Use this section to help your users successfully test your API, especially if they want to use your API in a production environment with real data.

Explain how a user can test whether their interactions with your API are working properly, including how to run the tests in a test environment.

If you have a sandbox environment where developers can experiment with your API, you should clearly explain the limitations of your sandbox environment compared to your production environment.

For example, if your sandbox environment only allows stateless testing, your users should know it is not as representative as stateful testing in production.
